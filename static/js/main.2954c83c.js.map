This is the base class for all tile layers and replaces `TileLayer.Canvas`.\n * GridLayer can be extended to create a tiled grid of HTML elements like `<canvas>`, `<img>` or `<div>`. GridLayer will handle creating and animating these DOM elements for you.\n *\n *\n * @section Synchronous usage\n * @example\n *\n * To create a custom layer, extend GridLayer and implement the `createTile()` method, which will be passed a `Point` object with the `x`, `y`, and `z` (zoom level) coordinates to draw your tile.\n *\n * ```js\n * var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({\n *     createTile: function(coords){\n *         // create a <canvas> element for drawing\n *         var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');\n *\n *         // setup tile width and height according to the options\n *         var size = this.getTileSize();\n *         tile.width = size.x;\n *         tile.height = size.y;\n *\n *         // get a canvas context and draw something on it using coords.x, coords.y and coords.z\n *         var ctx = tile.getContext('2d');\n *\n *         // return the tile so it can be rendered on screen\n *         return tile;\n *     }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @section Asynchronous usage\n * @example\n *\n * Tile creation can also be asynchronous, this is useful when using a third-party drawing library. Once the tile is finished drawing it can be passed to the `done()` callback.\n *\n * ```js\n * var CanvasLayer = L.GridLayer.extend({\n *     createTile: function(coords, done){\n *         var error;\n *\n *         // create a <canvas> element for drawing\n *         var tile = L.DomUtil.create('canvas', 'leaflet-tile');\n *\n *         // setup tile width and height according to the options\n *         var size = this.getTileSize();\n *         tile.width = size.x;\n *         tile.height = size.y;\n *\n *         // draw something asynchronously and pass the tile to the done() callback\n *         setTimeout(function() {\n *             done(error, tile);\n *         }, 1000);\n *\n *         return tile;\n *     }\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * @section\n */\n\n\nL.GridLayer = L.Layer.extend({\n\n\t// @section\n\t// @aka GridLayer options\n\toptions: {\n\t\t// @option tileSize: Number|Point = 256\n\t\t// Width and height of tiles in the grid.
